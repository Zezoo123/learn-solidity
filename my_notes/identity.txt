there is a variable (  this  ) like in oop to access the contract itself
this can be used to get the current balance for example -- address(this).balance

there is also a msg variable:
msg.sender gives the address of the contract which sent the message
msg.gas is a payemnt for the cost of processing the message
msg.value is a payment for the service represented by the message

require(msg.sender == owner) -- is the same as doing -- if (msg.sender != owner) {revert();}
require(msg.value > amount) -- to use this you must indicate that the function is payable
