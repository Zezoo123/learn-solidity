there is a variable (  this  ) like in oop to access the contract itself
this can be used to get the current balance for example -- address(this).balance

there is also a msg variable:
msg.sender gives the address of the contract which sent the message
there is more to do with this msg variable -- look into!

require(msg.sender == owner) -- is the same as doing -- if (msg.sender != owner) {revert();}
